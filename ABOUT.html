        Happy March! And March is fire prevention month so theres an article on how to prevent fires! As satisfing as watching things burn can be, watching your home, money and family burn with removes the 'satisfing' part (well unless you find that amusing, in that case please seek therapy or the police). So there are ways for us to prevent fires, now this dosent 100% guarantes that your house will never set on fire, this webpage does not grant fire immunity it simply reduces the chances of fires happening. Now accidents are bound to happen so in that scenario you should know what to do (ive listed some ways in the main page, though not in furrther detail). And mistakes are natural so in case that happens do listen to fire safety networks & read articles by your local government to prevent any severe loses, because sadly Bob Ross the mistake of forgetting to turn off the oven is not a 'happy little accident' (one can argue this speciic statement is about art, but using the oven and baking is an art. And also because I need to fill up space since about pages are usually long and since this is just  about one article im really scraping the bottom of the barrel.)
